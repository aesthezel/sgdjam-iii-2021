When importing sprites make sure to:


1. Set `pixels per unit = 40`
2. Filter mode `point(no filter)`
3. Compression `None`

When using Aseprite Importer make sure to set `pixels per unit = 40`

5. Press Apply!

Edit: This will be the standard behaviour since we've defined a new preset under Assets/settings/Custom presets
